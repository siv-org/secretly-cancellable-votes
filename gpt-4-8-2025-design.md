I want to use ristretto within a SNARK

## ChatGPT

Using **Ristretto** within a **SNARK** is tricky but doable with tradeoffs. Here's the situation:

### ❗ Problem

Ristretto operates over Curve25519 (field size ~2²⁵⁵), while most SNARKs (e.g. Groth16, Plonk) use scalar fields like BN254, which are much smaller (~2²⁵²). That means:

- You can’t directly do full Ristretto arithmetic inside a SNARK targeting BN254.
- Even if you switch to a larger SNARK-friendly field (like BLS12-381), it still involves heavy cost to emulate Curve25519 arithmetic.

### ✅ Options

#### 1. Simulate Ristretto in-circuit

- You can **reimplement the Ristretto encoding/decoding + point operations** inside the circuit, but:
  - You must do all arithmetic in a compatible base field (e.g., simulate `𝔽_p` where p = 2²⁵⁵ - 19 using a big enough SNARK field).
  - This is **very expensive** (hundreds of constraints per operation).

#### 2. Use native curve inside SNARK, map externally

- Inside the SNARK, use a SNARK-native curve like Baby Jubjub.
- Outside the SNARK, map values to/from Ristretto using agreed encoding or hash-to-curve trick.
- This avoids massive constraint blowup but limits what you can do inside the circuit (e.g. can't prove arbitrary Ristretto relationships inside).

#### 3. Use a SNARK over Curve25519’s field

- Some works explore SNARKs over large fields like 2²⁵⁵ - 19.
- **Examples:** Halo 2, zkInterface, custom PLONK backends.
- Still experimental or very resource-intensive.

### 🔧 Practical advice

If your SNARK must reason _directly_ about Ristretto points, consider:

- Using a larger curve-friendly SNARK backend (e.g. Plonky2, Nova with Poseidon/FRI).
- Or, avoid full Ristretto ops inside SNARKs. Instead, push as much Ristretto work out of the circuit, and only verify commitments/hashes in-circuit.

Want a minimal example of simulating Ristretto ops in Circom or a strategy for interfacing Ristretto and Baby Jubjub securely?

## User

This is what I'm trying to prove:

[[pasted in 2025-4-8 version of Overview.md]](https://github.com/siv-org/silently-cancellable-votes/blob/2936f4f3f12f16ad568cc05199bc91429090e91b/Overview.md)

## ChatGPT

Thanks — your notes are solid, and the design makes sense. Here's how you can approach Ristretto in Circom:

### ✅ Core Needs

To support your use case in-circuit, you’ll need:

#### 1. Edwards Point Representation

Use the twisted Edwards form of ed25519 (`-x² + y² = 1 + dx²y²`) in Circom. That’s what Electron Labs’ circom-ed25519 gives you.

Ristretto is a _compressed encoding_ of the prime-order subgroup of ed25519 — you don’t need to reimplement Ristretto in-circuit. You just need:

- A way to **import and operate on valid ed25519 points**
- A consistent out-of-circuit encoding/decoding of Ristretto → Ed25519 to map vote points

#### 2. Mimic Noble’s RP.fromHex

Out-of-circuit: decode Ristretto string to Ed25519 affine `(x, y)` point using noble. Then:

- Convert that point into inputs (wires) for Circom circuit
- Feed as constants/private inputs

#### 3. Operations

Electron Labs already supports:

- `add(P, Q)`
- `mul(P, scalar)` (via double-and-add)

You’ll wrap those for:

```ts
RP.add(a, b) => edAdd(a, b)
RP.multiply(p, r) => edMul(p, r)
```

#### 4. Merkle Inclusion

As you noted, use Poseidon-based Merkle trees.

- Build the tree externally (from `encrypted` points or their Poseidon hashes)
- In-circuit:
  - Hash the candidate ciphertext
  - Use Poseidon Merkle proof to show inclusion in the `all_encrypted_votes` tree

#### ⚙️ Implementation Guidance

- Convert vote plaintext → Ristretto outside circuit → ed25519 point → `(x, y)` → circuit input

- Inside circuit:
  - `vote_encoded: [x, y]`
  - `recipient: [x, y]`
  - `randomizer: scalar`
  - Compute:
    - `enc = edAdd(vote_encoded, edMul(recipient, randomizer))`
    - Hash `enc` to Poseidon leaf and do inclusion proof

Want a Circom template that wires in ed25519 ops and Ristretto decoding structure for one vote proof?

## User

Yep

## ChatGPT

[Wrote [zk_cancelled_votes_proof.circom](https://github.com/siv-org/silently-cancellable-votes/blob/c8db7789d8cf644a4d2d8ada8af8ed335901dd82/zk_cancelled_votes_proof.circom) file].

That’s a scaffolded circuit to prove each vote in a batch:

- corresponds to an encrypted Ristretto (Ed25519) point,
- uses recipient + randomizer,
- is included in the Merkle tree of all encrypted votes,
- contributes to a claimed sum hash (you can swap in your plaintext logic).

Next steps:

- Replace the `sumHashInputs[i]` logic with your own mapping from vote plaintext → category (e.g. `washington`, `arnold`)
- Preprocess all inputs (Ed25519 point coords, recipient, randomizers) in JS using noble

Want a sample JS preprocessor to output the Circom inputs from vote data?

## User

Yes

## ChatGPT

Here’s a JS preprocessor using noble-ed25519 and @noble/hashes/poseidon that prepares the circuit inputs per vote:

```ts
import { RistrettoPoint, utils } from '@noble/ed25519'
import { poseidon } from '@noble/hashes/poseidon'
import { bytesToNumberLE } from '@noble/hashes/utils'

// --- CONFIG ---
const TREE_DEPTH = 20 // match your Merkle tree height

// --- HELPERS ---

function toAffineCoords(point: RistrettoPoint) {
const edPoint = point.toRawBytes(true) // 32-byte compressed
const decompressed = RistrettoPoint.fromHex(edPoint)
const { x, y } = decompressed.toAffine()
return {
x: BigInt(x.toString()),
y: BigInt(y.toString())
}
}

function poseidonHash(...args: bigint[]) {
return poseidon(args.map(x => BigInt(x)))
}

// --- MAIN ---

export function prepareVoteInputs({
votesToCancel, // [{ plaintext, encoded, randomizer }]
recipientHex, // election pubkey as hex
merkleTree // Poseidon tree object from circomlibjs or similar
}) {
const recipient = RistrettoPoint.fromHex(recipientHex)

const encoded_x = []
const encoded_y = []
const randomizers = []
const merkleProofs = []
const merklePositions = []
const sumHashInputs = []

for (const vote of votesToCancel) {
const encodedPoint = RistrettoPoint.fromHex(vote.encoded)
const rand = BigInt(vote.randomizer)
const { x, y } = toAffineCoords(encodedPoint)

    encoded\_x.push(x)
    encoded\_y.push(y)
    randomizers.push(rand)

    const ciphertext = encodedPoint.add(recipient.multiply(rand))
    const { x: cx, y: cy } = toAffineCoords(ciphertext)
    const leaf = poseidonHash(cx, cy)

    const proof = merkleTree.getProof(leaf, TREE\_DEPTH)
    merkleProofs.push(proof.siblings)
    merklePositions.push(proof.pathIndices)
    sumHashInputs.push(leaf) // placeholder — replace if needed

}

const claimedSum = poseidonHash(...sumHashInputs)

return {
public: {
merkleRoot: merkleTree.root,
voteHash: poseidonHash(...sumHashInputs), // optional
claimedSum
},
private: {
encoded_x,
encoded_y,
randomizers,
merkleProofs,
merklePositions
}
}
}
```

Notes:

RistrettoPoint.toAffine() is a placeholder — you’ll need to patch noble to expose x/y in extended or affine form (or extract from internal).

Replace sumHashInputs logic with actual content extraction if you want per-category counts.

You can build the Merkle tree using circomlibjs Poseidon tree helpers.

Want help patching noble to extract x/y directly from Ristretto points?

## User

ok

## ChatGPT

To extract affine (x, y) coordinates from a RistrettoPoint using noble-ed25519, you need to:

Patch the library to expose the internal extended coordinates.

Convert to affine manually.

✅ Step-by-step patch

1. Patch noble-ed25519 to expose internal point
   Find this in node_modules/@noble/ed25519/ristretto.js:

\`\`\`ts
tsCopyEditclass RistrettoPoint {
constructor(ep) {
this.ep = ep; // ep = ExtendedPoint
}
// ...
}
\`\`\`

Below that, add:

\`\`\`ts
tsCopyEdit toExtended() {
return this.ep;
}
\`\`\`

2. Extract affine (x, y) from ExtendedPoint
   Now you can do:

\`\`\`ts
tsCopyEditimport { mod } from '@noble/ed25519/\_utils'
import { Field } from '@noble/ed25519/edwards'
import { RistrettoPoint } from '@noble/ed25519'

function toAffineCoords(rp: RistrettoPoint) {
const ext = rp.toExtended()
const Zinv = Field.invert(ext.z)
const x = mod(Field.multiply(ext.x, Zinv), Field.ORDER)
const y = mod(Field.multiply(ext.y, Zinv), Field.ORDER)
return { x, y }
}
\`\`\`

Now toAffineCoords(point) gives usable BigInts for Circom.

Let me know if you want this turned into a custom noble-ed25519 fork or wrapper module.

Risk of curve25519 points being re-used 8 times, unlike ristretto points? To cheat the uniqueness checks

## ChatGPT

Yes — this is a real risk if you use raw Curve25519 or Ed25519 points in a SNARK without safeguards:

⚠️ Problem: Cofactor = 8

Ed25519 and Curve25519 have cofactor 8.

That means each curve point in the full group corresponds to 8 different representations in the extended group.

A malicious prover could reuse a vote up to 8 times with different encodings and pass naive inclusion or uniqueness checks.

Why?
Because:

\`\`\`text
textCopyEditP ≠ Q but 8·P = 8·Q
\`\`\`

And if your circuit checks only 8·P values (or doesn’t check subgroup membership at all), then duplicates sneak through.

✅ Ristretto fixes this
Ristretto maps only the prime-order subgroup elements, eliminating the cofactor problem entirely:

Every Ristretto-encoded point is canonical

No duplicate representations

Hashing, equality, and inclusion checks are safe

🛠 Implication for your circuit
If you're using Ed25519 in-circuit (not Ristretto):

You must enforce subgroup membership — e.g., require cofactor · P ≠ 0

Better: Only accept points generated from canonical Ristretto encodings

If you preprocess votes using Ristretto → Ed25519, and only allow those, you inherit Ristretto’s safety guarantees.

✅ Recommendation
In your SNARK:

Only accept vote points that were produced via Ristretto decoding

Include a flag/input to confirm "this point came from Ristretto"

(Optional) Multiply input point by cofactor and check it’s not identity — expensive but effective

Would you like a constraint-friendly check for subgroup membership (e.g., 8·P ≠ 0) in Circom?

## User

How to only accept vote points that were produced via Ristretto decoding

## ChatGPT

To ensure a vote point was produced via Ristretto decoding, you must prove that it came from a canonical encoding — i.e., a valid Ristretto-encoded 32-byte string. But:

Ristretto decoding is not circuit-friendly — it’s a complex process involving square roots, field inversions, and case distinctions.

So inside a SNARK, you don’t reimplement Ristretto decoding. Instead:

✅ Strategy: Prove Outside, Commit Inside
Off-circuit (in JS):

Only accept votes where the encoded string is:

A valid Ristretto point (RistrettoPoint.fromHex(...) succeeds)

Decode to Ed25519 point → extract affine (x, y)

Feed (x, y) as the only form of the vote point into the circuit

Hash the original 32-byte encoding with Poseidon (or SHA, depending on design)

Use this hash as a uniqueness commitment inside the circuit

In-circuit (in Circom):

Accept (x, y) as vote input

Accept the hash of the original Ristretto encoding

For uniqueness checks:

Use the hash of the original 32-byte Ristretto encoding

These are unique if you only accept canonical Ristretto strings externally

🔐 Why this works
Ristretto guarantees:

Each encoding uniquely identifies one group element

There is only one encoding per point

If you restrict yourself to known-good Ristretto strings, no duplicates exist

So you don’t need to prove in-circuit that a point is Ristretto — just commit to its Ristretto hash and enforce external validation.

✅ Summary

Off-circuit: enforce Ristretto point validity with noble

In-circuit: accept (x, y) + Poseidon hash of encoded 32-byte string

Uniqueness: check uniqueness of the hash values inside or outside circuit

Want a hashing function that converts Ristretto bytes to Poseidon leaf hashes for uniqueness checks?

## User

How does this prevent malicious prover from cheating during pre-processing step? They won't necessarily restrict themselves to known good ristretto strings

## ChatGPT

You're right — if the malicious prover controls preprocessing, and you just trust their (x, y) and claimed "this came from Ristretto", they can cheat by feeding in non-canonical, cofactor-variant points.
So the system must make cheating impossible, not just “unlikely”.

✅ Solution: Commit to the Ristretto encoding and prove consistency
You must enforce two properties:

The point inside the circuit corresponds to a Ristretto encoding

The encoding used externally is unique for the point

This way, malicious re-encoding or cofactor-variant points can’t sneak in.

🔐 Real Fix (practical + sound):
You don't put Ristretto decoding in the circuit. Instead:

Public input: Poseidon hash of the original Ristretto encoding (H(ristretto_bytes))

Private input: (x, y) coordinates derived externally from ristretto_bytes

Inside the circuit:

Hash (x, y) → Poseidon

Prove: H(x, y) == H(ristretto_bytes)

BUT: this only works if the verifier independently checks off-circuit that:

The claimed ristretto_bytes are valid (canonical, decode successfully)

The (x, y) inside the proof are indeed the result of decoding those bytes

So you now shift trust to a deterministic preprocessing step — auditable, reproducible — which enforces:

Only canonical encodings allowed

Hash commitments are consistent with in-circuit points

🧱 Enforcement Options
Option A: Trusted Setup Phase or Verifier-Side Check

Election authority precomputes (x, y) from Ristretto and publishes their hashes

Prover can only use one of those approved (x, y) points

Inclusion is proved in-circuit via Merkle

Option B: Require proof of valid encoding (expensive)

Fully implement Ristretto decoding logic in-circuit (not recommended)

~5,000–10,000 constraints per point

✅ What This Prevents

Malicious prover creating 8 variants of the same logical vote

Re-encoding vote with different low-order components

Submitting points outside the prime-order subgroup

Let me know if you want:

A concrete workflow for verifier-side hash validation

A Poseidon-based commitment circuit that hashes (x, y) to compare with H(ristretto_bytes)

## User

This can work fine for the list of all_public_encrypted_votes, but not for the secret_votes_to_cancel, because those are secret. If we published hashes of them, it would be easy to brute force discover which ones they are

## ChatGPT

Exactly — for the public list of all encrypted votes, you can precommit to known-good Ristretto points and validate inclusion in-circuit.
But for the secret votes being cancelled, you’re right:

🧨 Publishing hashes of Ristretto encodings (or even Poseidon(x, y)) would leak information.

Someone could precompute all possible encodings and match.

✅ What You Need for Secret Votes
You want to privately prove that each secret vote corresponds to a valid Ristretto point without revealing which one. But you still need to:

Prevent cofactor abuse

Avoid leaking information via published hashes

So we revise the strategy:

🔐 Revised Proof Strategy
In-circuit:

Take input (x, y) of the vote

Multiply by 8: P8 = 8·(x, y)

Assert that P8 ≠ 0 (or some fixed basepoint), to prove subgroup membership

This prevents cofactor subgroup attacks by ensuring the point is in the prime-order subgroup, i.e., Ristretto’s safe set.
You no longer need to publish or hash the Ristretto encoding at all.

✅ Why this works
Ristretto = prime-order subgroup of Ed25519

Multiplying by 8 kills low-order junk:

If P is a cofactor-variant point → 8·P = 0

If P ∈ prime-order subgroup → 8·P ≠ 0

🛠 How to check in Circom
You need:

A scalar multiply circuit: P8 = mul(P, 8)

A not-equal-to-zero circuit: P8 ≠ identity

Can be done using ed25519-circom:

\`\`\`ts
tsCopyEditcomponent mul8 = Ed25519ScalarMult();
mul8.P[0] <== vote_x;
mul8.P[1] <== vote_y;
mul8.e <== 8;

component notZero = NotEqualEd25519(); // You’d need to implement this
notZero.P[0] <== mul8.out[0];
notZero.P[1] <== mul8.out[1];
\`\`\`

✅ Summary

For public set: commit to canonical Ristretto encodings

For secret votes: require that (x, y) is in prime-order subgroup by enforcing 8·P ≠ 0

Avoids cofactor abuse without leaking identities via hashes

Want help wiring a NotEqualEd25519 circuit to check P ≠ identity in Circom?

## User

sure

## ChatGPT

Here’s a minimal Circom circuit to check that an Ed25519 point (x, y) is not the identity (i.e. not the neutral element 0 = (0,1)):

📦 NotIdentityEd25519.circom

\`\`\`circom
circomCopyEdit// Checks that (x, y) ≠ (0, 1)

template NotIdentityEd25519() {
signal input x;
signal input y;

    signal isXZero;
    signal isYOne;
    signal isIdentity;

    // x == 0
    isXZero <== IsEqual()(x, 0);

    // y == 1
    isYOne <== IsEqual()(y, 1);

    // isIdentity = isXZero AND isYOne
    isIdentity <== isXZero \* isYOne;

    // Enforce that it's NOT the identity
    // So: isIdentity == 0
    isIdentity === 0;

}
\`\`\`

Usage inside your main circuit

\`\`\`circom
circomCopyEditcomponent mul8 = Ed25519ScalarMult();
mul8.P[0] <== vote_x;
mul8.P[1] <== vote_y;
mul8.e <== 8;

component notIdentity = NotIdentityEd25519();
notIdentity.x <== mul8.out[0];
notIdentity.y <== mul8.out[1];
\`\`\`

✅ Guarantees
This enforces that your point is:

Not one of the 8 cofactor variants

In the correct Ristretto subgroup

Safe for uniqueness, vote validity, etc.

Let me know if you want a variation that allows identity in some edge cases (e.g., test-only), or compresses to fewer constraints.
